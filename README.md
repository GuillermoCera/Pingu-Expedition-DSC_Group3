It simulates how research teams co-develop shared project materials.

The **Pingu Research Group** explores penguin habitats, behaviors, and — very importantly — their preferred nicknames.  
During this workshop, we form small **expedition teams** and contribute to a **shared knowledge base** documenting our field expeditions.

Each team works in its own branch, adding a folder `Expedition_your-name/` for their expedition that contains:
- a short written field note (`Doc.md`),
- a table with a small set of penguin traits in `Data.csv`,
- and one or two open-license images in `Images/`.

At the end, contributions are brought together using Pull Requests, merging each expedition branch into the main project repository.

Be curious.  
Be collaborative.  
Be kind.  
Ask questions.
And stay warm out there.
